## My solutions to katas

I will try to give basic answers to challenges on [Codewars](http://codewars.com) with comments on why/what is that in code.
All solutions are based on javascript syntax. 

## Materials

Those solutions are based on what I learnt from resources below:

* `Javascript & jQuery` by Jon Duckett - It is really good as first book, which introduce a lot of topics and cool techniques.
* `JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts` on [Udemy Online Courses](www.udemy.com) - pure masterpiece if You want to know ins and outs of javascript. 
* `www.javascript30.com` - 30 practical projects based on pure javascript (with ES6). 
* `Eloquent Javascript`by Marijn Haverbeke - currently taking shot on this. Fourth chapter and already learnt much.
