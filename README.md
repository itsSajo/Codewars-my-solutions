## My Codewars solutions

I will try to give basic answers to challenges on [www.codewars.com] with comments on why/what is that in code.
All solutions are based on javascript syntax. 

## Materials

Those solutions are based on what I learnt from resources below:

..* `Javascript & jQuery` by Jon Duckett - It is really good as first book, which introduce a lot of topics and cool techniques.
..* `JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts` on [udemy.com] - pure masterpiece if You want to know ins and outs of javascript. 
..* `[www.javascript30.com]` - 30 practical projects based on pure javascript (with ES6). 
..* `Eloquent Javascript` - currently taking shot on this. Fourth chapter and already learnt much.
